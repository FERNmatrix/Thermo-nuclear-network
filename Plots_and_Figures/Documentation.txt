This is a place to record the prosses of testing the Asy and the Asy+Pe with the new timestepper. Initialy on the triple alpha and then on the full alpha. 


To Do: 

1). Verify Asy is working correctly with new timestepper.
    1.a). Create repository of all data files.
    1.b). Compare thrugh scripts or superposition.
    1.c). Make convincing figure that says as much with correct lables. 

2).  Verify Asy+Pe is working correctly with new timestepper.
    2.a). same as 1.a)
    2.b). same as 1.b)
    2.c). same as 1.c)

3). Now repete steps 1) and 2) but on full alpha.
