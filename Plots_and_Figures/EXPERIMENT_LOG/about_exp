Experiment are a method developed by me and my team to catalog our progress in reserching the Explicit Matrix C++ Code

what follows, is a detailed description of the experiment format.

The experiment is a standardised file folder structure that assists in the cataloging data about edits of the C++ code. 
The name of any experiment is { EXP_Name_Date }. Where Name is replaced by the name of the experiment, and Date is replaced by the date the experiment started. 
# we could also have a procedure for renaming it after the experiment is completed 
The contence of the folder will be called an entry, 

1). The first entry of an experiment is a documentation of the modification to the C++ code.
2). The second entry is a  "Ticker_Tape" readout of every "computer action", The vaiable TC.
3). The third entry is all standard relivant data/plots i.e. t vs. dt; t vs. mass fraction.
4). The fourth entry is any extra relivant data/plots.
5). The fith and last is a text document that has an experiment report.
