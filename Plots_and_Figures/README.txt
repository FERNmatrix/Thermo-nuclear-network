See reop branch 'Plots_and_Figures'

*discription of repository*

Each folder contains both figures( PDF, LaTex, ect) and GNU scripts for recreation.
to do:

1). find optimum test values for temperature and density. (T9 = 7 & roh = 1e8)
2). test pure ASY and find best parameters; create both mass fraction and timestep plots
3). test pure QSS and find best parameters; create both mass fraction and timestep plots
4). test ASY+PE and find best parameters; create both mass fraction and timestep plots
5). compare to benchmark and see if there is an improvement.

6). do steps 1-5 for Full Alpha.
