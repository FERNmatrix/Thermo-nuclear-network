# Thermo-nuclear-network

This repo will serve as the centralized version control for developments in our thermonuclear network algorithm. I have attempted to make
the organization of the repo as self-explanatory as possible but for the sake of completeness, I will outline it here.

#### explicitMatrix
The explicitMatrix/ directory is the main directory where active development of the explicit matrix computation algorithm occurs. 

#### old_explicitMatrix
This directory includes older C and C++ versions of explicitMatrix as well as other data files.

#### matlab
The matlab/ directory is the location of all previous Matlab based development files, primarily written by Nick Brey.

#### Prev_Presentations_Papers
The Prev_Presentations_Papers/ directory stores relevant publications and presentations related to both thermonuclear networks and
neutrino transport

#### tars
The tars/ directory stores archives of multiple previous developments including the GUI based Java program from which our current 
work is based, old Cuda code, a basic tutorial on gnuplot from Dr. Guidry, the original verison of the current explicitMatrix directory
(in Cversion.tar.gz), and an older version of the Collisionator code which Eirik, Adam, and Dr. Guidry have been developing for the 
neutrino transport problem.

#### tutorials
The tutorials/ directory stores multiple simple tutorials which Dr. Guidry has created for student use to explain gnuplot, the GSL library,
and a refresher on C arrays and pointers. Also a directory of pdf files giving a simple tutorial on basics of git/github.
