1. Note that in Linux may need to add -lm compile flag to get the math.h header to work
for defining powf, expf, logf, ...  For example,
    
    gcc explicitMatrix.c -o explicitMatrix -lm 

See https://www.includehelp.com/c-programming-questions/error-undefined-reference-to-pow-in-linux.aspx

2.  Code compiled above can then be executed with Linux with

./explicitMatrix  | tee temp.txt

where | tee temp.txt allows output to screen and also piped to a file temp.txt.

Execution for Mac or PC will depend on the C compiler installed on your machine.
