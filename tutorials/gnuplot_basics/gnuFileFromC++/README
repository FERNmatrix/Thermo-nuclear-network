Example of outputting a data file in text format from a C/C++ program
and reading the data file and plotting with gnuplot. Compile and execute
the C++ program.  On my Fedora Linux system I used

> gcc gnuFile.cpp -o gnuFile -lm -lstdc++
> ./gnuFile

to compile and execute.  This produces a data file gnufile.data, which
can be plotted with

> gnuplot
gnuplot> load "gnuplot_example.gnu"

which should read the data file, plot to the screen, and also output the plot files
