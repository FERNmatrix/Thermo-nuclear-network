For Linux Fedora:

Documentation for GSL matrix operations in

https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/vectors.html

1.  Need to install as superuser (assuming Fedora linux)

gsl libraries:

> dnf install gsl-2.4-8.fc30.x86_64

headers and stuff:

> dnf install gsl-devel

2.  Requires several linking library flags in gcc command.  For example,

gcc matrixGSL.c -o matrixGSL  -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

which executes with

./matrixGSL
